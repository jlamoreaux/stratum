/**
 * Publish a tree to Vercel with `POST /v13/deployments`, which builds the
 * uploaded source remotely.
 *
 * ## PRD Q1, resolved: files are inlined in the create-deployment body
 *
 * Vercel's current create-deployment reference documents both routes — "upload
 * files first via the file upload API, then reference them here by SHA — or
 * inline small files directly in the request body" — and the `files` array
 * accepts either `{ file, data, encoding }` (inline) or `{ file, sha, size }`
 * (by reference). Inlining wins here for a reason specific to running inside a
 * Worker: `POST /v2/files` is **one request per file**, so a 2,000-file tree
 * (`MAX_FILES`) would need 2,001 provider requests, while inlining needs
 * exactly one no matter how many files there are. The subrequest budget is the
 * scarce resource, not the request body.
 *
 * The cost of that choice, stated so the next person does not have to
 * rediscover it: base64 inflates the payload by about a third, so
 * `MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` (25 MB) becomes roughly a 33 MB request body. That is the
 * binding constraint on this target. **If `MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` is ever raised,
 * revisit this decision** — past some size the two-step upload-by-sha flow
 * becomes the only workable one, and it will need `MAX_FILES` lowered to fit
 * inside `MAX_SUBREQUESTS`.
 *
 * ## Asynchronous by design
 *
 * The API answers as soon as the deployment is *queued*: the response carries
 * `readyState` (`QUEUED` → `INITIALIZING` → `BUILDING` → `READY`/`ERROR`), not
 * a finished build. This target reports what the provider said and does not
 * poll — polling would hold a queue message open for the length of someone
 * else's build. `state` is on the outcome so the runner can decide.
