 * client that gets one carrying `resource_metadata` knows exactly where to go
 * to register and authorize. That is what lets someone paste a URL into their
 * editor and have the OAuth flow start on its own, with nothing else
 * configured — so this header is load-bearing UX, not decoration.

 * which fails as an unauthenticated sub-request rather than as a loud error.
