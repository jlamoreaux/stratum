/**
 * The per-request logger, carrying the request id `authMiddleware` minted.
 *
 * Every route used to build its own logger from the path and method, which
 * dropped the request id: a middleware warning and the route's own line for
 * the same request could not be joined in Workers Logs, so "auth rejected the
 * token" and "the token endpoint answered 401" looked like unrelated events.
 * The middleware stores its logger on the context before it does anything
 * else, so routes read that one. The fallback exists for routers mounted in
 * tests without the middleware; it carries the same path and method fields,
 * minus the id.
