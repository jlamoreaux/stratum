 * upstream unmodified carries no such duty, and the default below already
 * points at the source of what is running.
 *
 * If you deploy changes of your own, repoint this at the repository holding

 * answer is fixed for a deployment, and a modified deployment is by definition
 * already editing this file's neighbours.
