/**
 * Consumer for the `stratum-deploys` queue.
 *
 * The interesting decisions here are all about *when a message comes back*.
 * `runDeployMessage` never throws and splits its outcomes into three:
 *
 * - `ok` with `aborted` — the message can never succeed (no `projectId`, a
 *   reverted change, a deleting project, an unknown deployment row). Redelivery
 *   would replay the same refusal until the retry budget ran out, so it is
 *   acked.
 * - `ok` otherwise — every deployment the message named reached a terminal
 *   status. A `failed` row is a *result*, not a delivery failure: retrying it
 *   would re-run a deploy the operator has to fix and re-trigger by hand.
 * - `err` — the run could not determine what happened (D1 or KV unavailable,
 *   the project unreadable). This is the only case redelivery helps, and it is
 *   safe: the `ux_deployments_attempt` unique index and `claimDeployment`'s
 *   lease give mutual exclusion, so a redelivered message cannot double-deploy.
 *
 * A malformed body is acked with a logged error rather than retried. Nothing
 * about redelivering a message the runner cannot parse changes its shape, and
 * the retry budget would only delay the DLQ.

/**
 * Enqueue a merged change for deployment — best effort, and deliberately gated

 *
 * **Why this is not driven by the `change.merged` event.** `change.merged` is
 * emitted *before* `runPostMergeCheck` runs, and a post-merge failure
 * auto-reverts the merge. Subscribing the deploy trigger to that event would
 * therefore publish the exact commit Stratum had just decided to revert. The
 * only safe trigger is the post-merge result, which is why callers pass it in
 * and why `reverted` and `failed` are refused here rather than at the call
 * site: both merge paths must make the same decision.
 *
 * `skipped` and `passed` both deploy. `skipped` means no post-merge command is
 * configured — the overwhelmingly common case — and treating "the operator
 * declared no smoke check" as "do not deploy" would make deployments
 * unreachable for almost every project.
 *
 * A queue-send failure is logged and swallowed: the merge has already happened
 * and the response describes it truthfully. Failing the request over an
 * undeliverable deploy would report a completed merge as an error.
 *
 * **The message carries the merge time.** Every deployment row is ordered by it
 * rather than by when its message is processed, because the queue promises no
 * ordering and a retry reorders outright — see `DeployQueueMessage.mergedAt`.

 * runs *after* `runPostMergeCheck`, and that check can spend minutes in a

 * behind a later merge whose check was skipped — reintroducing the reordering
 * this field exists to remove, just one layer up from the queue.
 *
 * Falls back to the clock when the row cannot be read or carries a `merged_at`
 * the deployments columns would reject. That is strictly better than sending
 * nothing: an approximate merge time still orders correctly against every other
 * merge whose time is known, and the runner's own fallback then never has to
 * fire. A caller-supplied `mergedAt` wins over both, for a path that already
