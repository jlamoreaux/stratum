/**
 * The OAuth 2.1 authorization server behind the remote MCP endpoint (#349).
 *
 * Stratum is an OAuth *client* elsewhere (GitHub and Google sign-in, in
 * routes/auth.ts). This file is the other half: Stratum as the authorization
 * *server*, because a remote MCP endpoint has no other way to let an editor the
 * user has never told us about act on their behalf.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing and every function here is written around
 * them:
 *
 *  1. **The client table is written by anonymous callers.** MCP clients
 *     self-register (RFC 7591) — an editor discovers the server from a pasted
 *     URL. So a registered client proves nothing about who registered it, and
 *     the only things standing between a hostile registration and someone's
 *     account are the exact redirect-URI match, PKCE, and the consent screen.
 *  2. **Every secret is stored hashed**, never in plaintext — codes included.
 *     A code is a bearer credential for the seconds it lives, and it is read by
 *     an unauthenticated endpoint.
 *  3. **Expiry is compared in JavaScript, never in SQL.** This codebase stores
 *     both `datetime('now')` (`"… 12:00:00"`) and ISO
 *     (`"…T12:00:00.000Z"`), and `' '` (0x20) sorts below `'T'` (0x54), so
 *     `WHERE expires_at > datetime('now')` against an ISO value reads every
 *     expired row as live. `api_tokens` dodges this the same way (see 042).
