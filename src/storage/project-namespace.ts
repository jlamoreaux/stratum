/*
 * A personal project is keyed under its owner's username, in KV. A username
 * change must therefore refuse while any project exists, and project creation
 * must not land under a name its owner has just given up. The two operations
 * touch different stores, and KV listings are only eventually consistent, so
 * KV alone cannot order them. D1 can: creation records a claim here before it
 * writes KV, and the rename (renameUser) refuses in the same UPDATE when a
 * claim exists. Whichever of the two reaches D1 first wins, and the loser sees
 * it: a rename after a claim is refused; a claim after a rename is caught by
 * confirmOwnerNamespace, which re-reads the owner and withdraws the project.
 *
 * A claim is released when its project is withdrawn during creation, and the
 * release is best effort: D1 can fail right after KV succeeded, and nothing
 * durable retries it. So a claim is not trusted forever. Past CLAIM_GRACE_MS
 * the KV entry is visible everywhere, and ownerHasClaims checks the claim
 * against it, dropping one with no project behind it, whether the release
 * failed or the project was deleted later. Within the window the claim is
 * taken at its word, which is the whole point of having it.
