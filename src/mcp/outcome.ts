/**
 * What to log about one MCP exchange (#355).
 *
 * The endpoint used to log a single debug line per message, which the default
 * info level suppressed, so a connector that connected and then failed every
 * tool call left no trace beyond auth-middleware warnings. This turns each
 * (message, reply) pair into a log entry at the level it deserves: the
 * handshake at info, because "Claude connected, speaking protocol X" is the
 * first thing an operator wants to see; a tool that ran and failed at warn,
 * with the tool name and the error the model was shown; everything routine at
 * debug.
 *
 * Kept as a pure function, separate from the transport-agnostic protocol
 * layer, so it is testable by handing it plain objects.

 * instance and may quote the error a model was shown; an analytics event
 * leaves for a third party and may carry only bounded values. The overlap is
 * real but the constraint is not shared, so merging them would mean one
 * function whose output is safe for exactly one of its two consumers.
 *
 * Returns `null` for anything that did not run: a malformed message, and a
 * notification (which `handleMessage` answers with no reply, without invoking
 * the tool). Counting those as tool calls would overstate MCP usage with
 * traffic that never reached a tool.
