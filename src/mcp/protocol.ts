/**
 * The JSON-RPC 2.0 / MCP message layer (#349).
 *
 * Deliberately transport-agnostic: it turns one parsed JSON-RPC message into
 * one reply (or `null`, for a notification), and knows nothing about HTTP. The
 * route in `src/routes/mcp.ts` owns framing, auth and status codes. Keeping the
 * split means the protocol is testable by handing it plain objects, which is
 * how `tests/mcp-endpoint.test.ts` exercises it.
 *
 * MCP is a thin layer over JSON-RPC, and the parts that matter here are the
 * handshake (`initialize`), discovery (`tools/list`) and invocation
 * (`tools/call`). Everything else in the spec — prompts, resources, sampling —
 * is capability-gated, and we advertise only `tools`, so a well-behaved client
 * never asks for the rest.
