/**
 * Issue #349: the connected-applications section of the settings page.
 *
 * The property under test is that "no applications connected" and "we could not
 * check" never render the same. One of them is a reassurance, and showing it to
 * someone whose grant listing D1 failed to return would tell them nothing can
 * reach their account when something might.
 *
 * `loadOAuthGrants` returns an empty array in BOTH cases, so the distinction
 * lives entirely in the flag threaded alongside it — which is exactly the kind
 * of thing that regresses silently without a test.
