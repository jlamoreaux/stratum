-- OAuth 2.1 authorization server for the remote MCP endpoint (#349).
--
-- MCP clients cannot be pre-registered: an editor discovers the server from a
-- URL the user pastes and registers itself on the spot (RFC 7591). So the
-- client table is written by unauthenticated callers, and every constraint that
-- matters — exact redirect-URI match, PKCE, short code lifetimes — has to hold
-- against a client that anyone could have created.
--
-- Timestamps are ISO 8601 strings written by the application, NEVER
-- `datetime('now')`. The two formats sort differently (' ' < 'T'), so a mixed
-- comparison reads an expired credential as live; expiry is therefore always
-- compared in JavaScript, exactly as `api_tokens` does (see 042).

-- A dynamically registered MCP client. `id` IS the client_id — public, quotable
-- in a redirect, and useless without either a secret or a PKCE verifier.
